## Instructions
To make use of this python script you might want to install a python package named bs4.
BeautifulSoup is the one that we will be using to scrape and parse through the html response


Assuming that you have python and pip installed, install BeautifulSoup by opening the terminal and

    pip3 install bs4

or

    pip install bs4

(depending on the python package manager that you've installed on your system)
